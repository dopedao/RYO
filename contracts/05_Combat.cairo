##### Module 05 #####
#
# The fighter contract has no storage - it attempts to create complex
# interrelated dynamics requiring many computations to make the game
# interesting. The contract accepts two fighters and emits events
# during a multi-round battle. The winner is decided and is passed
# for storage in module 06. King-of-the-Hill style game. Module 01
# gives users taxes/cuts in a location if they are the curent Drug Lord.
